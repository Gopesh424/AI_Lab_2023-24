### REGISTER NUMBER : 212223060070
### AIM: 
To write a program to train the classifier for Iris Flower classification.
### Algorithm:
Decision Tree Classifier (Supervised Learning)

Step 1: Load the dataset.

Step 2: Split the data into training and testing sets.

Step 3: Train the Decision Tree classifier on the training set.

Step 4: Test the classifier on the testing set.

Step 5: Evaluate accuracy and make predictions.

### Program:
# Import required libraries
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data   # Features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
y = iris.target # Labels: 0 = setosa, 1 = versicolor, 2 = virginica

# Split dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize Decision Tree Classifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()

# Train the classifier
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on test data
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)

# Predicting a new sample
sample = [[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]]  # Example: Features of a flower
prediction = iris.target_names[clf.predict(sample)[0]]
print("Predicted class for sample:", prediction)


### Output:
Accuracy: 1.0
Predicted class for sample: setosa


### Result:
Thus the system was trained successfully and the prediction was carried out.
